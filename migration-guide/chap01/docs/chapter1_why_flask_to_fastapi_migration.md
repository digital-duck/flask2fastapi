# Flask to FastAPI Migration Guide

## Chapter 1: Executive Summary & Business Case

### Executive Summary

Our current chatbot infrastructure handles 700 concurrent users across 4 ECS instances. By migrating from Flask to FastAPI, we can achieve **3-5x performance improvement** while **reducing infrastructure costs by 60-75%**. This migration will enable us to handle 2,000-3,500+ concurrent users with the same or fewer resources.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Cost Reduction**: Reduce ECS instances from 4 to 1-2, saving $2,000-3,000/month
- **Performance Improvement**: 3-5x concurrent user capacity with lower latency
- **Better User Experience**: Faster response times and improved reliability
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: Modern async framework built for high-concurrency workloads

## Current State Analysis

### Performance Bottlenecks
Our Flask-based architecture faces several limitations:

| Metric | Current (Flask) | Target (FastAPI) |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| Concurrent Users | 700 | 2,000-3,500+ |
| Users per Instance | ~175 | 1,000-1,750+ |
| Response Time | 200-500ms | 100-300ms |
| Memory per Connection | High | Low |
| CPU Utilization | 60-80% | 30-50% |

### Cost Impact
- **Current**: 4 ECS instances × $500/month = $2,000/month
- **Projected**: 1-2 ECS instances × $500/month = $500-1,000/month
- **Annual Savings**: $12,000-18,000

## Why FastAPI Outperforms Flask

### 1. Asynchronous Architecture
```python
# Flask (Blocking)
@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    response = bedrock_client.invoke_model(...)  # Blocks thread
    return jsonify(response)

# FastAPI (Non-blocking)
@app.post('/chat')
async def chat():
    response = await bedrock_client.invoke_model(...)  # Non-blocking
    return response
```

### 2. Concurrency Model Comparison

**Flask (WSGI)**
- Each request requires a separate worker process/thread
- Limited by number of CPU cores (typically 4-8 workers)
- Memory overhead: ~50MB per worker
- Blocking I/O operations

**FastAPI (ASGI)**
- Single process handles thousands of concurrent connections
- Event loop efficiently manages I/O operations
- Memory overhead: ~1-2MB per connection
- Non-blocking I/O operations

### 3. Perfect for Chatbot Workloads
Chatbots are I/O bound (waiting for AWS Bedrock responses). FastAPI's async nature means:
- While waiting for Bedrock API response, the server can handle other requests
- No thread blocking during external API calls
- Efficient resource utilization during peak loads
