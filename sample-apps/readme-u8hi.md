# Repositories to be used for Flask-to-FastAPI migration

Let me search for a more comprehensive Flask-based application that would be perfect for your migration project.Perfect! I found an excellent Flask application that would be ideal for your migration project. Let me also check one more comprehensive option:Based on my research, I found two excellent Flask applications that would be perfect for your Flask-to-FastAPI migration project. Here are my recommendations:

## **Top Recommendation: MedAssistant**
**Repository:** https://github.com/GabrieleLagani/MedAssistant

This is an ideal choice because it includes **all the components** you mentioned:

### **Features that make it perfect:**
- **Flask-based web application** with a complete chat interface
- **LLM integration** using LLama 3.1 via Ollama (local, no API keys needed)
- **RAG implementation** with LangChain for knowledge retrieval
- **Vector store** using FAISS for document embeddings
- **Regular database** using SQLite with patient/doctor/appointment data
- **Medical knowledge base** integration using MedQuad datasets
- **Chat history management** and download functionality
- **Emergency reporting system** with color-coded alerts
- **Appointment scheduling** with database interactions

### **Technical Stack:**
- **Backend:** Flask with Python 3.10
- **LLM:** LLama 3.1 via Ollama
- **Vector Store:** FAISS
- **Database:** SQLite with complex schemas
- **RAG:** LangChain with agents and tools
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS interface

## **Alternative Option: Chat-With-PDFs-RAG-LLM**
**Repository:** https://github.com/omkars20/Chat-With-PDFs-RAG-LLM-

This is simpler but still comprehensive:
- **Flask backend** with PDF processing
- **MySQL database** for persistent storage
- **FAISS vector store** for embeddings
- **LangChain RAG** implementation
- **React frontend** (adds migration complexity)
- **OpenAI API** integration

## **Why MedAssistant is Perfect for Your Project:**

1. **Comprehensive Feature Set:** It demonstrates real-world complexity with multiple databases, vector stores, and LLM interactions
2. **Local Setup:** No external API dependencies make it easier to work with
3. **Rich Functionality:** Appointment scheduling, emergency handling, chat history - lots of components to migrate
4. **Well-Structured:** Clear separation of concerns that will translate well to FastAPI
5. **Educational Value:** Medical domain adds interesting context for your book project

The MedAssistant application would give you plenty of material to document the migration journey, from basic Flask routes to complex async database operations, RAG implementation, and real-time chat functionality in FastAPI.

Would you like me to help you analyze the MedAssistant codebase structure to plan your migration approach?


# Sample Apps

## FastAPI based

- https://github.com/souvikmajumder26/Multi-Agent-Medical-Assistant
    - very good example of multi-agent system with FastAPI, multi-modal chat, and RAG 
    - forked to wgong  

## Flask based

- https://github.com/GabrieleLagani/MedAssistant
    - Comprehensive Flask application with LLM, RAG, and database integration
    - Perfect for migration to FastAPI with complex features
    - forked to wgong  

### not good

- https://github.com/Mayank77maruti/Heal-Smart/tree/main
    - only frontend, but has a good design
