# Repositories to be used for Flask-to-FastAPI migration

Let me search for a more comprehensive Flask-based application that would be perfect for your migration project.Perfect! I found an excellent Flask application that would be ideal for your migration project. Let me also check one more comprehensive option:Based on my research, I found two excellent Flask applications that would be perfect for your Flask-to-FastAPI migration project. Here are my recommendations:

## **Top Recommendation: MedAssistant**
**Repository:** https://github.com/GabrieleLagani/MedAssistant

This is an ideal choice because it includes **all the components** you mentioned:

### **Features that make it perfect:**
- **Flask-based web application** with a complete chat interface
- **LLM integration** using LLama 3.1 via Ollama (local, no API keys needed)
- **RAG implementation** with LangChain for knowledge retrieval
- **Vector store** using FAISS for document embeddings
- **Regular database** using SQLite with patient/doctor/appointment data
- **Medical knowledge base** integration using MedQuad datasets
- **Chat history management** and download functionality
- **Emergency reporting system** with color-coded alerts
- **Appointment scheduling** with database interactions

### **Technical Stack:**
- **Backend:** Flask with Python 3.10
- **LLM:** LLama 3.1 via Ollama
- **Vector Store:** FAISS
- **Database:** SQLite with complex schemas
- **RAG:** LangChain with agents and tools
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS interface

## **Alternative Option: Chat-With-PDFs-RAG-LLM**
**Repository:** https://github.com/omkars20/Chat-With-PDFs-RAG-LLM-

This is simpler but still comprehensive:
- **Flask backend** with PDF processing
- **MySQL database** for persistent storage
- **FAISS vector store** for embeddings
- **LangChain RAG** implementation
- **React frontend** (adds migration complexity)
- **OpenAI API** integration

## **Why MedAssistant is Perfect for Your Project:**

1. **Comprehensive Feature Set:** It demonstrates real-world complexity with multiple databases, vector stores, and LLM interactions
2. **Local Setup:** No external API dependencies make it easier to work with
3. **Rich Functionality:** Appointment scheduling, emergency handling, chat history - lots of components to migrate
4. **Well-Structured:** Clear separation of concerns that will translate well to FastAPI
5. **Educational Value:** Medical domain adds interesting context for your book project

The MedAssistant application would give you plenty of material to document the migration journey, from basic Flask routes to complex async database operations, RAG implementation, and real-time chat functionality in FastAPI.

Would you like me to help you analyze the MedAssistant codebase structure to plan your migration approach?


# Sample Apps

## FastAPI based

- https://github.com/souvikmajumder26/Multi-Agent-Medical-Assistant
    - very good example of multi-agent system with FastAPI, multi-modal chat, and RAG 
    - forked to wgong  

## Flask based

- https://github.com/GabrieleLagani/MedAssistant
    - Comprehensive Flask application with LLM, RAG, and database integration
    - Perfect for migration to FastAPI with complex features
    - forked to wgong  

### not good

- https://github.com/Mayank77maruti/Heal-Smart/tree/main
    - only frontend, but has a good design

- https://github.com/omkars20/Chat-With-PDFs-RAG-LLM-
- https://github.com/bhushankorg/Medical-Assistant 


## Jupyter Notebook / Gradio
- https://github.com/kmnis/DocScribe
    - a POC from Univ of Chicago, with good potential


Excellent discovery! You've found two perfect repositories that showcase the exact contrast your Flask-to-FastAPI migration guide needs:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Perfect Migration Project Candidates:**

### **Option 1: souvikmajumder26/Multi-Agent-Medical-Assistant (FastAPI)**
The Multi-Agent Medical Assistant is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist with medical diagnosis, research, and patient interactions. It uses FastAPI and integrates Multi-Agent Orchestration with structured graph workflows, Advanced RAG Techniques â€“ hybrid retrieval, semantic chunking, and vector search, and Confidence-Based Routing & Agent-to-Agent Handoff

**Tech Stack:**
- âœ… **FastAPI backend** (already implemented)
- âœ… **400+ stars** (proven popular)
- âœ… **Production-ready** with Docker, CI/CD
- âœ… **Complex features**: Multi-agent, RAG, Computer Vision
- âœ… **Well-documented** with detailed README

### **Option 2: GabrieleLagani/MedAssistant (Flask)**
This is a toy Web application written in Flask, featuring a Medical Assistant Chatbot powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). It uses langchain as underlying library, leveraging langchain's agents and tools to build a RAG system that can use tools such as vector stores and SQL databases

**Tech Stack:**
- âœ… **Flask backend** (perfect for migration)
- âœ… **LLM + RAG implementation**
- âœ… **Local setup** (SQLite, FAISS, Ollama)
- âœ… **Manageable scope** for migration project

## ðŸš€ **Strategic Approach for Your Guide:**

### **Phase 1: Study the FastAPI Implementation**
Use the Multi-Agent Medical Assistant as a **reference architecture** to understand:
- How FastAPI handles async RAG operations
- Multi-agent patterns in production
- Modern Python project structure
- Testing and deployment practices

### **Phase 2: Migrate the Flask Version**
Use GabrieleLagani's MedAssistant as your **migration target**:
- **Smaller scope** - manageable for a comprehensive guide
- **Real-world complexity** - RAG, agents, databases
- **Clear before/after** comparison opportunity
- **Educational value** - perfect learning progression

## ðŸ’¡ **Content Strategy for Your Guide:**

```markdown
# Flask to FastAPI Migration: Medical Assistant Case Study

## Part 1: Understanding Modern FastAPI Architecture
- Analyze souvikmajumder26/Multi-Agent-Medical-Assistant
- Learn async patterns, project structure, testing

## Part 2: Hands-on Migration
- Fork GabrieleLagani/MedAssistant (Flask)
- Step-by-step migration to FastAPI
- Document challenges and solutions

## Part 3: Modernization & Optimization
- Apply lessons from the FastAPI reference
- Add async features, better testing, deployment
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **This Creates Perfect Learning Content:**

1. **Real-world relevance** - Medical AI is hot topic
2. **Complexity progression** - From simple to advanced
3. **Practical application** - RAG + LLMs in production
4. **Before/after showcase** - Clear migration benefits
5. **Community value** - Contributing to open source projects

This approach gives you both a **learning reference** (the FastAPI version) and a **practical migration target** (the Flask version). Your guide will be incredibly valuable because it shows real migration of a complex, modern application rather than toy examples!
