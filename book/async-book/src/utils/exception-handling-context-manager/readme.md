Absolutely! Here are two practical examples that would be perfect for your Flask-to-FastAPI migration guide:These examples demonstrate key concepts that are crucial for Flask-to-FastAPI migration:

## üî• **Example 1: Exception Handling**
- **Real-world scenario**: Fetching user data from APIs (common in web apps)
- **Key techniques**:
  - `asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)` for handling partial failures
  - Specific exception types (`TimeoutError`, `ClientError`)
  - Graceful degradation (returning `None` for failures)
  - Proper logging for debugging

## üèóÔ∏è **Example 2: Async Context Managers**
- **Database connection management**: Critical for FastAPI apps
- **Proper resource cleanup**: Even when exceptions occur
- **Transaction handling**: Shows rollback on errors
- **Advanced pooling**: Resource reuse patterns

## üí° **Why This Matters for Your Migration Guide:**

1. **Flask users** are used to synchronous exception handling - async adds complexity
2. **Database connections** need different patterns in async (connection pooling becomes crucial)
3. **Resource management** is more important with async due to concurrency
4. **Error propagation** works differently with `asyncio.gather()`

## üéØ **Key Learning Points:**
- `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` for async context managers
- `return_exceptions=True` prevents one failure from killing all concurrent operations
- Proper cleanup in `__aexit__` regardless of success/failure
- Resource pooling patterns for async applications

These examples would fit perfectly in your Flask-to-FastAPI guide, showing developers how to handle the async patterns they'll encounter when migrating their applications!
